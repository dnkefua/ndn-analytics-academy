# Firebase Project Setup & SDK Initialization

Google Firebase provides a unified suite of cloud services for mobile and web development — authentication, a real-time NoSQL database, serverless compute, storage, and hosting — all backed by Google Cloud Platform. In this lesson we initialize Firebase SDK v12 inside a TypeScript + Vite application the way production teams do it.

## 1. Create the Firebase Project

1. Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and click **Add project**.
2. Name it (e.g. \`ndn-analytics-academy\`). The project ID becomes your global namespace — it cannot be changed later.
3. Decide on Google Analytics. For production apps, enable it; you can wire BigQuery export later.
4. Under **Project settings → Your apps**, register a *Web app*. Firebase generates the client configuration object you will consume via environment variables.

> A Firebase project **is** a Google Cloud project. Everything you create here — Firestore, Functions, Storage buckets — appears in the GCP Console under the same project ID.

## 2. Store Credentials in Environment Variables

Never hard-code configuration into source files. Create a \`.env\` file (and add it to \`.gitignore\`):

\`\`\`bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyA_ExampleKeyHere
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=ndn-analytics-academy.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=ndn-analytics-academy
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=ndn-analytics-academy.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234567890
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456
\`\`\`

The Firebase web API key is *not* a secret — it identifies your project, and access is enforced by Security Rules — but treating it as configuration keeps environments (dev/staging/prod) cleanly separated.

## 3. Initialize the SDK with a Singleton

Create \`src/lib/firebase.ts\`:

\`\`\`typescript
import { initializeApp, getApps, getApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
};

// Singleton pattern: re-use the app across hot reloads and re-renders
const app = getApps().length > 0 ? getApp() : initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
\`\`\`

Why the singleton? Vite hot-module-replacement and React StrictMode both re-execute module code. Calling \`initializeApp\` twice with the same name throws \`app/duplicate-app\`. Guarding with \`getApps()\` makes initialization idempotent.

## 4. Verify the Connection

\`\`\`typescript
import { collection, getDocs } from "firebase/firestore";
import { db } from "./lib/firebase";

const snapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, "healthcheck"));
console.log("Firestore reachable — docs:", snapshot.size);
\`\`\`

If this resolves without a permissions error (default rules deny everything — that is expected and healthy), your pipeline is live.

# Video Briefing

This official Firebase video walks through creating a project and connecting a web app end-to-end.

**Watch for:**
- How the Firebase Console and the GCP Console expose the *same* project from two angles.
- Where the web app config object lives (Project settings → Your apps) and how it maps to your \`.env\`.
- The Spark (free) vs Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan differences — Cloud Functions and App Hosting require Blaze.

**After watching**, open [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com), select the same project, and find: Firestore, IAM & Admin, and Billing. Set a **budget alert at $10/month** — this is the single most valuable habit for learners on Blaze.

# Firebase Authentication, JWTs & Custom Claims

Firebase Authentication issues **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** that identify your users to Firestore, Storage, Functions, and your own APIs. Understanding the token lifecycle is the foundation of every security decision you will make in this course.

## 1. Sign-In Flows

\`\`\`typescript
import {
  getAuth, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithEmailAndPassword,
  GoogleAuthProvider, signInWithPopup, onAuthStateChanged
} from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth();

// Email/password registration
await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, "student@ndn.dev", "S3curePassw0rd!");

// Google OAuth popup
await signInWithPopup(auth, new GoogleAuthProvider());

// The one listener every app needs — fires on login, logout, and token restore
onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
  console.log(user ? \`Signed in as \${user.uid}\` : "Signed out");
});
\`\`\`

\`onAuthStateChanged\` is the source of truth. Never gate UI on a one-time check — session restoration is asynchronous.

## 2. Anatomy of the ID Token

Every signed-in user carries an ID token (a JWT) with three parts: header, payload, signature. The payload includes \`uid\`, \`email\`, expiry (\`exp\`, one hour), and any **custom claims** you attach. Firestore Security Rules read this token as \`request.auth\`.

## 3. Custom Claims for Role-Based Access Control

Roles like \`INSTRUCTOR\` or \`admin\` must be set **server-side** with the Admin SDK — never from the client:

\`\`\`typescript
import * as admin from "firebase-admin";

export async function grantInstructor(uid: string) {
  await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, { academyRole: "INSTRUCTOR" });
}
\`\`\`

Claims are baked into the *next* token that gets minted. The client must force a refresh to pick them up:

\`\`\`typescript
await auth.currentUser?.getIdToken(true); // true = force refresh
\`\`\`

## 4. Verifying Tokens on Your Backend

Any Express/Cloud Run API you build must verify tokens before trusting them:

\`\`\`typescript
const decoded = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(bearerToken);
if (decoded.academyRole !== "INSTRUCTOR") throw new Error("Forbidden");
\`\`\`

This is the zero-trust posture: the client asserts nothing; the server verifies everything.

**Watch for:**
- Enabling providers in the Console (Email/Password, Google) before writing any code.
- How the SDK persists sessions in IndexedDB and restores them on reload.
- Error handling patterns for common codes: \`auth/email-already-in-use\`, \`auth/wrong-password\`, \`auth/popup-blocked\`.

# Firestore Data Modeling — Collections, Documents & Indexes

Firestore is a **document database**: data lives in documents (max 1 MiB) grouped into collections. There are no joins — your schema is shaped by your *queries*, not by normalization theory.

## 1. Model Around Read Patterns

For a learning platform:

\`\`\`text
users/{userId}                      → profile, role
courses/{courseId}                  → catalog metadata
courses/{courseId}/modules/{modId}  → subcollection: syllabus structure
enrollments/{enrollmentId}          → root collection: userId + courseId + progress
\`\`\`

Rules of thumb:
- **Subcollections** when children are always fetched *through* the parent (modules of a course).
- **Root collections** when you query across parents (all enrollments for a user, regardless of course).
- **Duplicate data deliberately** (e.g. store courseTitle inside the enrollment) to avoid N+1 reads. Storage is cheap; reads are the billing unit.

## 2. Querying

\`\`\`typescript
import { collection, query, where, orderBy, limit, getDocs } from "firebase/firestore";

const topEnrollments = query(
  collection(db, "enrollments"),
  where("status", "==", "PASSED"),
  orderBy("score", "desc"),
  limit(5)
);
const snap = await getDocs(topEnrollments);
\`\`\`

Combining an equality filter with an \`orderBy\` on a *different* field requires a **compound index**. Firestore fails fast with an error containing a console link that creates the exact index — click it, wait for the build, re-run.

Declare indexes in \`firestore.indexes.json\` and deploy them with the CLI so environments stay reproducible:

\`\`\`json
{ "indexes": [{
  "collectionGroup": "enrollments",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "score", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]}]
}
\`\`\`

## 3. Pagination with Cursors

Never use offset-based pagination (you pay for skipped docs). Use cursors:

\`\`\`typescript
import { startAfter } from "firebase/firestore";
const lastDoc = snap.docs[snap.docs.length - 1];
const nextPage = query(
  collection(db, "enrollments"),
  orderBy("score", "desc"),
  startAfter(lastDoc),
  limit(5)
);
\`\`\`

## 4. Real-Time Listeners

\`\`\`typescript
import { onSnapshot } from "firebase/firestore";
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(topEnrollments, (snap) => {
  snap.docChanges().forEach(c => console.log(c.type, c.doc.id));
});
// Always clean up: unsubscribe() on unmount
\`\`\`

Listeners deliver local writes instantly (latency compensation) and reconcile with the server — this is what makes Firestore apps feel real-time.
`,
    terminalLanguage: "typescript",
    starterCode: `import { collection, query, where, orderBy, limit, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';\n\n// Build the top-5 passed enrollments query\nconsole.log("Query built: enrollments where status == PASSED order by score desc limit 5");`,

# Zero-Trust Firestore Security Rules

Your Firestore database is directly reachable from any browser with your project ID. **Security Rules are your only server** between an attacker and your data. The zero-trust principle: deny everything, then allow specific, verified operations.

## 1. Structure of a Ruleset

\`\`\`text
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // matches go here
  }
}
\`\`\`

Rules do not cascade *permissions* — but a broad \`allow read, write: if true\` anywhere is a total breach. Start from implicit deny.

## 2. Ownership & Role-Based Access

\`\`\`text
function isSignedIn() { return request.auth != null; }
function isOwner(userId) { return isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId; }
function hasRole(r) { return isSignedIn() && request.auth.token.academyRole == r; }

match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if isOwner(userId) || hasRole('INSTRUCTOR');
  allow create, update: if isOwner(userId);
  allow delete: if false; // nobody deletes profiles from the client
}

match /certificates/{certId} {
  allow read: if true;                    // public verification
  allow write: if hasRole('INSTRUCTOR');  // only staff issue certs
}
\`\`\`

\`request.auth.token\` exposes the JWT payload — including the custom claims you set in Module 2. This is RBAC with zero extra reads.

## 3. Schema Validation in Rules

Rules can validate the *shape* of writes:

\`\`\`text
match /enrollments/{id} {
  allow create: if isSignedIn()
    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
    && request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['userId', 'courseId', 'status'])
    && request.resource.data.status in ['ACTIVE', 'PASSED', 'WITHDRAWN']
    && request.resource.data.score is int
    && request.resource.data.score >= 0 && request.resource.data.score <= 100;
}
\`\`\`

\`request.resource.data\` is the incoming document; \`resource.data\` is the existing one. Comparing them lets you make fields immutable:

\`\`\`text
allow update: if request.resource.data.userId == resource.data.userId; // can't reassign ownership
\`\`\`

## 4. Test with the Emulator — Before You Deploy

\`\`\`bash
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
npm i -D @firebase/rules-unit-testing
\`\`\`

\`\`\`typescript
import { assertFails, assertSucceeds, initializeTestEnvironment } from "@firebase/rules-unit-testing";

const env = await initializeTestEnvironment({ projectId: "demo-ndn" });
const alice = env.authenticatedContext("alice").firestore();
const mallory = env.authenticatedContext("mallory").firestore();

await assertSucceeds(alice.doc("users/alice").set({ name: "Alice" }));
await assertFails(mallory.doc("users/alice").set({ name: "Pwned" }));
\`\`\`

Untested rules are unverified claims. Treat the rules test suite like any other CI gate.

# Video Briefing

A Firebase Developer Advocate explains the rules engine from first principles.

**Watch for:**
- Why rules are *not* filters — a query must be provably safe for every possible result, or it fails entirely.
- How \`match\` blocks and wildcards (\`{userId}\`, \`{document=**}\`) bind path segments to variables.
- The evaluation model: any single \`allow\` that passes grants access.

**Red-flag patterns to memorize:** \`allow read, write: if true\` (open database), \`if request.auth != null\` alone (any signed-in stranger), and validating with \`resource.data\` when you meant \`request.resource.data\`.

# Cloud Functions — Triggers, Idempotency & Cold Starts

Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd gen, built on Cloud Run) lets you run backend code in response to events with zero server management. Three trigger families cover most production needs.

## 1. HTTPS Callable Functions

\`\`\`typescript
import { onCall, HttpsError } from "firebase-functions/v2/https";

export const issueCertificate = onCall(async (request) => {
  if (request.auth?.token.academyRole !== "INSTRUCTOR") {
    throw new HttpsError("permission-denied", "Instructor role required.");
  }
  const { studentId, courseId } = request.data;
  // ... write certificate doc with Admin SDK (bypasses rules)
  return { issued: true };
});
\`\`\`

Callable functions handle CORS and token verification for you — \`request.auth\` is pre-verified.

## 2. Firestore Triggers

\`\`\`typescript
import { onDocumentCreated } from "firebase-functions/v2/firestore";

export const onEnrollment = onDocumentCreated("enrollments/{id}", async (event) => {
  const data = event.data?.data();
  // send welcome email, increment course counters, etc.
});
\`\`\`

**Critical: triggers can fire more than once.** Event delivery is at-least-once. Make handlers **idempotent** — e.g. write derived data keyed by the event/document ID so a replay overwrites instead of duplicating:

\`\`\`typescript
await db.doc(\`emails/\${event.params.id}-welcome\`).set({ queuedAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp() });
\`\`\`

## 3. Scheduled Functions

\`\`\`typescript
import { onSchedule } from "firebase-functions/v2/scheduler";

export const nightlyDigest = onSchedule("every day 02:00", async () => {
  // aggregate yesterday's quiz attempts into a stats doc
});
\`\`\`

## 4. Cold Starts & Tuning

A cold start is the latency of provisioning a new instance (typically 1–4 s for Node). Mitigations:

- Keep bundles small: lazy-import heavy SDKs *inside* the handler.
- Set \`minInstances: 1\` for latency-critical functions (costs ~$5–10/month per instance).
- Reuse clients across invocations by initializing them at module scope.

\`\`\`typescript
export const api = onCall({ region: "europe-west1", minInstances: 1, memory: "512MiB" }, handler);
\`\`\`

## 5. Local Development

\`\`\`bash
firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore
\`\`\`

The emulator suite runs triggers against local Firestore writes — the full event loop, on your laptop, for free.

# Connecting Firebase Frontends to Cloud Run Services

When your backend outgrows individual functions — long-running work, custom runtimes, WebSockets, heavier memory — **Cloud Run** runs any container as an autoscaling HTTPS service. The integration pattern with Firebase is one of the most useful architectures in the Google ecosystem.

## 1. The Contract: Bind to PORT on 0.0.0.0

Cloud Run injects a \`PORT\` env var and health-checks it. This is the #1 deployment failure:

\`\`\`typescript
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.get("/healthz", (_req, res) => res.json({ ok: true }));

const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 8080;
app.listen(port, "0.0.0.0", () => console.log(\`listening on \${port}\`));
\`\`\`

Binding to \`localhost\` instead of \`0.0.0.0\` fails the health check and the revision never goes live.

## 2. Verify Firebase ID Tokens in the Service

Your Cloud Run API must not trust callers blindly. Verify the JWT with the Admin SDK:

\`\`\`typescript
import * as admin from "firebase-admin";
admin.initializeApp(); // uses the service's runtime identity on GCP

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace("Bearer ", "");
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: "missing token" });
  try {
    (req as any).user = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token);
    next();
  } catch {
    res.status(403).json({ error: "invalid token" });
  }
});
\`\`\`

## 3. Call It from the Firebase Client

\`\`\`typescript
const token = await auth.currentUser!.getIdToken();
const res = await fetch("https://api-xyz-ew.a.run.app/reports", {
  headers: { Authorization: \`Bearer \${token}\` },
});
\`\`\`

## 4. Deploy

\`\`\`bash
gcloud run deploy academy-api \\
  --source . \\
  --region europe-west1 \\
  --allow-unauthenticated \\
  --memory 512Mi --min-instances 0 --max-instances 10
\`\`\`

\`--source .\` uses Cloud Build + buildpacks — no Dockerfile required (you'll write real Dockerfiles in NDN-GCP-501). \`--allow-unauthenticated\` is correct here because *your middleware* does auth; the alternative is IAM-gated invocation for service-to-service calls.

## 5. Scale-to-Zero Economics

Cloud Run bills per 100 ms of request processing. Idle services cost nothing at \`min-instances 0\`. For spiky academic workloads this is dramatically cheaper than an always-on VM.

# Firebase App Hosting — apphosting.yaml, Secrets & CI/CD

Firebase App Hosting is Google's opinionated hosting for full-stack web apps: it connects to your GitHub repo, builds with Cloud Build, runs your server on Cloud Run, and fronts everything with Cloud CDN. You configure it declaratively.

## 1. apphosting.yaml

\`\`\`yaml
runConfig:
  minInstances: 0
  maxInstances: 4
  concurrency: 80
  cpu: 1
  memoryMiB: 512

env:
  - variable: NODE_ENV
    value: production
    availability: [BUILD, RUNTIME]

  - variable: VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    secret: firebaseApiKey          # ← Secret Manager reference
    availability: [BUILD, RUNTIME]
\`\`\`

Two availability scopes matter: **BUILD** (Vite needs VITE_* vars at build time to inline them) and **RUNTIME** (your Node server reads process.env). Getting this wrong produces the classic "works locally, undefined in prod" bug.

## 2. Secrets via Secret Manager

\`\`\`bash
firebase apphosting:secrets:set geminiApiKey
# paste value; then grant access:
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess geminiApiKey --backend academy-web
\`\`\`

Secrets never live in the repo or the YAML — only *references* do. Rotation is a Secret Manager version bump, no redeploy of code.

## 3. Rollouts from GitHub

Connect the backend to a GitHub branch (usually \`main\`). Every push triggers: Cloud Build → container image → new Cloud Run revision → gradual traffic rollout. Failed health checks auto-halt the rollout, keeping the last good revision serving.

## 4. The Server Contract (again)

App Hosting runs your server on Cloud Run, so the same rules apply:

\`\`\`typescript
const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 8080;
app.listen(port, "0.0.0.0");
\`\`\`

And your \`package.json\` needs a real \`start\` script that launches the built server — App Hosting runs \`npm run start\` in the production container.

## 5. Monitoring the Rollout

\`\`\`bash
firebase apphosting:backends:list
firebase apphosting:rollouts:list --backend academy-web
\`\`\`

Watch the first deploy in the Console: build logs, then revision health, then domain propagation. A green rollout ends with your app on \`https://<backend>--<project>.<region>.hosted.app\`.

# Video Briefing

This official session covers serving dynamic content alongside static assets in the Firebase hosting family — the exact split App Hosting automates for you.

**Watch for:**
- The static-vs-dynamic boundary: what the CDN serves directly vs. what hits your server.
- How rewrites route requests to backend compute.
- Cache-control headers and why immutable hashed assets should be cached for a year.

**Connect it:** in App Hosting, this whole pipeline (CDN + build + Cloud Run) is provisioned from one YAML file and a GitHub connection.

    notes: {
      coreConcepts: "Static assets belong on the CDN with long cache lifetimes; only genuinely dynamic requests should reach compute. App Hosting wires this split automatically.",
      proTip: "Verify your cache headers with 'curl -I' against the deployed URL — a missing max-age on hashed assets silently multiplies your serving costs.",

# Practical Lab

The graduation exercise for this course's infrastructure track: take your app live. Connect GitHub, write apphosting.yaml with correct BUILD/RUNTIME scopes, bind one Secret Manager secret, and complete a green rollout.

Complete the lab in the **Lab Studio** panel below and submit your deployed URL for verification.
`,
    notes: {
      coreConcepts: "A production deploy is only done when the rollout is green, the URL serves, and secrets came from Secret Manager — not .env files in the image.",
      proTip: "If the build succeeds but the rollout hangs 'unhealthy', it's almost always the PORT/0.0.0.0 contract or a missing start script — check revision logs first.",

        { term: "Green Rollout", definition: "A deployment that passed build, health checks, and full traffic migration." }
